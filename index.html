            <h2>About Us</h2>
          </div>
          <p> We are a group of students that are trying to create a global repository about bacteria, but with different science perspectives in order not only to fully understand their nature but also to allow everyone to have a full suite about what tool can help us to do so.</p><p> On the mathematical side, we have develop diferent functions that can emulate and predict bacteria growth and some properties.</p> <p>On the biological one we have develop full documentation about how to replicate bacteria experiments, information to understand them and biliography to go deeper in the subject.</p><p> Furthermore we have develop some functions that allow us to recognise different bacteria colonies from photos that will allow us (and every people) to create live simulations from photos in the future.</p> <p>Finally we have develop a web app that allow every one to take a brief look in our work and try their own experiments.</p> <p>In the future we expect to develop this web app and transform it in the first social network to share bacteria experiments around the world between scientist, students, teaches and everyday people. This may be a powerfull tool that may lead to facilitate the biologists work in microbiology (even discover some home-experiments about antibiotics that could discover new ones) </p>

            <h2>Project motivation</h2>
          </div>
		<h3>What?</h3>

<p>We live in a world where we have more and more access to new technologies. However, usually, all the potential hidden under computer science usually goes unnoticed in areas that are not very technical.</p>

<p>We find that the microbiological world is more relevant in research these days and always on everyone's lips. Understand it could lead us to a new era due to the fact that we are deeply surrounding by microbes.</p>

<p>From the beginning of our project we saw that joining tools for experiments on bacteria (from all fields of science) can make a big difference in their study, even more if we offer a service with all of them and from all possible areas.</p>

		<h3>How?</h3>

<p>Our project consists essentially of 2 interconnected parts:

<p>On the one hand we have a repertoire of tools for bacterial growth studies from the point of view of image processing, mathematical prediction and biological experimentation. Knowing what algorithms use ore what bacterias cultivate was the most diffcult part. This is also motivate by the fact that some of them are not usual ( 2-dimensional fkpp simulations are rare, for example. And the one we have created can be found at the top 3 in the first page of google)</p>

<p>All projects are open source, so all these tools can be used in academic or social areas, such as citizen laboratories.</p>

<p>Apart from all these free/open tools, we believed that a good way to create a community could be to centralize the prediction and storage service of biological experiments via the web. So we create one web-app.</p>

<p>This app will allow you to have information and predictions of experiments, accessible to everyone.</p>



		<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>The vision of so many points of view in science can lead to new and exciting discoveries.</p> 

<p>This set of tools and information is a small step in collecting information by study objects, not by scientific branches allowing interaction not only between creators and consumers but also between consumers.</p>

<p>And it is important that this be developed in an open manner, thus facilitating the birth of associated projects or unexpected advances. As our slogan says, it is time for science to evolve, be free and global.</p>


		<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>All methodology files can be found at our repositories. Take a look in our last part of "Our project" section to understand how to surf in our github without getting lost!</p>
