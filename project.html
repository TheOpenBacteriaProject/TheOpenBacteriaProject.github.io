            <h2>Overview of our project</h2>
          <p>Graduado en Matemáticas por la Universidad de Granada y actualmente en el Máster en Física y Matemáticas con la especialidad de Biofísica y Biomatemáticas. Me encanta la matemática aplicada, y estudio para especializarme en abordar desde el punto de vista matemático y computacional problemas originados en la biología. Me apasiona la bioinformatica, la comunicación científica y los retos. También colaboro en proyectos open source y varias asociaciones de Granada.

            <h2>Jesus Bueno Urbano</h2>
          <p>I am a first year PhD student from the University of Edinburgh where I research how the canopy structure of savanna ecosystems is changing due to climate change. I have used R on a range of projects, from analysing employee satisfaction data for a private equity firm to mining linguistic transcripts for speech patterns. Through my own work, I have gained experience in using R for statistical modelling, mapping, data manipulation and R-markdown to make reproducible scripts. I have experience designing sustainable projects through my work in nature conservation and as the student representative for the Edinburgh University School of GeoSciences. I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia. I am part of the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Programme.</a></p>

            <h2>Miguel Lopez Perez</h2>
          <p>I'm in my 4th (and last!) year of my undergraduate degree in Ecological and Environmental Sciences. My interests lie in sustainable development and peaceful coexistence with nature i.e. permaculture and my passion is definitely wildlife conservation! My dissertation will focus on biodiversity changes and ecosystem interactions across altitudes, with access to data from cloud forests in Peru and alpine tundra in Canada. For this, I will of course, be using R. I was introduced to R two years ago and since then have become fascinated by with what computers can produce with a simple script of code. It has been a love-hate relationship (but mostly love) and I want to show as many people as possible that coding is not as abstract or inaccessible as it looks!</p>

            <h2>Olivia Marin Delgado</h2>
          <p>I'm an undergraduate in my final year studying ecological & environmental sciences at the University of Edinburgh, with my honours project focusing on quantifying the above-ground carbon stored in Arctic ecosystems. Over the years I've delved into many projects, from founding Elpis Solar, a non-profit developing solar-powered infrastructure for refugee camps, to establishing the Edinburgh Mindfulness Ambassador Award and Social Innovation Forum. Coding Club is a unique opportunity for students across the department of Geosciences to broaden their knowledge and advance their field through working at the intersection of Environmental Science and Informatics. I am excited to be part of this journey!</p>

            <h2>Enrique Casale Linde</h2>
          <p>I am a third year PhD student investigating the responses of tundra vegetation to climate change in the Arctic and the role of plant-plant interactions in modifying these responses. I have been using statistical programming since the beginning of my PhD and am therefore very familiar with the R language. I have experience teaching coding to undergraduate students as a demonstrator on the course “Ecological and Environmental Analysis”. I am excited to be part of this project, as I wish a similar opportunity had been available when I started teaching myself programming. </p>

            <h2>Paula de la Hoz Garrido</h2>
          <p>I’m a third year <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 DTP</a> PhD student investigating the causes and consequences of vegetation change in the tundra biome. My research requires a range of coding tools and software, from using GitHub repositories to hierarchical Bayesian modelling (which I still haven’t quite grasped yet!). I had never even used R before starting my PhD, so a course like this earlier on in my research career would have been immensely valuable: this is a great opportunity to pass on the skills I have learnt onto others. I have a large amount of teaching experience, both as a tutor for Masters and Undergraduate course and as a demonstrator in previous statistics classes, and have been previously nominated for a teaching award.</p>
