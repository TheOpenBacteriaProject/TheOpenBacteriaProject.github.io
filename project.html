            <h2>Overview of our project</h2>
          <p> We are very interested in interdisciplinarity. So we are mixing biology, computer science and mathematics in our project. 
we want to create a platform that serves as a social network to connect scientists from all over the world. In this platform, they can upload their experiments (for example, of bacteria growth as we propose).
  Not only it will serve as a place to upload experiments. They will have a wide range of utilities they can use to extract information, conclusions or improve their studies.
              This app will count with mathematical models that can be use to predict or estimate the possible results of an experiment. We can tune the parameters of
              the model in order to see the posterior behaviour of the population of bacterias, for example (all of this can be extrapolated to other kind of experiments).
              As in an usual social network they can share, comment and rate the experiments so we are favorating the transference of knowledge. We can use other things
              like gamification to motivate studies that can be result tedious at first.
              
             Our work does not end here. We not only want to develop software that can facilitate the work of many scientists but also develop a hardware tool compatible with our app.
              We can obtain more information and facilitate the work if we had a camera which can continuously take pictures of a petri dish while the experiment is being carried out and then process them and upload them to the platform extracting information from them.
              
              Our whole project is in the philosophy of open science so we will use free software (python) and free hardware (arduino).

            <h2>Mathematical simulations</h2>
          <p>How can we predict bacteria behaviour? Can maths help us with this? Absolutely yes! In our mathematical repository you can learn how math models can be applied in bacteria growth. We have develop our main algorithm from a classical numircal scheme in a wellknown (but not to simulated) 2d-equation. Here you can learn about why this equation it's used, discretization an much more. But, what is more important, you can learn basic principles in mathematical modelization to try them in the future with your research or simulation</p>
